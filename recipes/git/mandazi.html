    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Activate yeast</h3>
            -In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare dough</h3>
            <p>-In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, sugar, cardamom, and salt. Mix well.</p>
            <p>-Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the activated yeast mixture, coconut milk, and melted butter (or oil).</p>
            <p>-Mix until a sticky dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, gradually add more flour until it becomes manageable.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Knead the Dough</h3>
            -Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead for about 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>First Rise</h3>
            -Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Shape the Mandazi</h3>
            <P>-Once the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a floured surface. Roll the dough out to about 1/2 inch thickness.</P>
            <p>-Cut the dough into desired shapes (triangles or circles) using a knife or cookie cutter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Second Rise</h3>
            -Place the cut dough on a floured surface or parchment paper. Cover with a cloth and let them rise for an additional 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Fry the Mandazi</h3>
            <p>-Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or fryer to about 350°F (175°C). Carefully drop the dough pieces into the hot oil, a few at a time, without overcrowding.</p>
            <p>-Fry for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to remove the Mandazi and place them on paper towels to drain excess oil.</p>

        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Serve</h3>
            -Let the Mandazi cool slightly before serving. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature, dusted with powdered sugar or served with tea.
