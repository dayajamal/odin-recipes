        <li>
        <h3>Prepare the Dough</h3>
        <p>-In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</p>
        <p>-If using, add the oil or ghee to the flour and mix it in with your fingers until it resembles coarse crumbs.</p>
        <p>-Gradually add the warm water, a little at a time, while mixing the dough with your hand or a spoon. Continue until the dough starts to come together.</p>
        <p>-Knead the dough in the bowl or on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour. If it's too dry, add a bit more water.</p>
        <p>-Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 20-30 minutes. This helps the gluten to relax, making it easier to roll out the chapatis.</p>
            </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Shape the Chapatis</h3>
            <p>-After resting, divide the dough into 8-10 equal portions (balls).</p>
            <p>-On a floured surface, flatten one ball of dough with your fingers, then roll it out into a thin circle about 6-8 inches in diameter. Use a rolling pin and keep the dough lightly floured to prevent sticking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook the Chapatis</h3>
            <p>Heat a tava, griddle, or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
            </p>
            <p>Once hot, place the rolled-out chapati onto the skillet. Cook until you see bubbles forming on the surface, about 30 seconds to 1 minute</p>
            <p>Flip the chapati using tongs or a spatula. Cook the other side until small brown spots appear.</p>
            <p>For the traditional puffed effect, press gently on the chapati with a cloth or spatula. It should puff up. Flip it once more if needed.</p>
            <p>Remove from the skillet and place in a container lined with a cloth to keep warm and soft. Repeat with the remaining dough balls.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Serve</h3>
            Serve the chapatis warm with curries, vegetables, or your favorite dishes.

        <h3>Tips</h3>
      
      <li>Consistency: The dough should be soft but not sticky. It should be pliable and easy to roll out.</li>
      <li>Resting: Do not skip the resting time; it helps to make rolling easier and the chapatis softer.</li>
      <li>Cooking: Make sure the skillet is hot enough for the chapatis to cook quickly and evenly.</li>
     <p>Enjoy your chapatis as a versatile and tasty accompaniment to a variety of meals</p>
